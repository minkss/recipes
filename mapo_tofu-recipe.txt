Ingredients

    1/2 cup low sodium chicken broth
    2 teaspoons potato starch (halve if using cornstarch)
    2 teaspoons soy sauce
    1 teaspoon sugar
    1 tablespoon sesame oil
    2 medium cloves of garlic, minced
    2 teaspoons minced ginger
    4 green onions white part only, minced
    1 tablespoon fermented black beans, roughly chopped (black bean paste will also work)
    1/2 teaspoon Sichuan peppercorns, black seeds removed then ground (optional)
    6 ounces ground pork
    2 teaspoons doubanjiang (chili bean paste)
    14 ounce block of silken tofu, drained and cut into 3/4” cubes
    green part of green onions minced for garnish

 Directions
    1.Add the chicken stock, cornstarch, soy sauce and sugar to a small bowl and stir to combine.
      
    2.Heat a wok or large frying pan until hot. Add the sesame oil, garlic, ginger and green onions and stir-fry with a spatula until fragrant. Add the black beans and Sichuan pepper and continue stir-frying.
     
    3.Add the ground pork and use the spatula to break it up into small grains (you don’t want clumps of meat). When the pork is cooked, add the doubanjiang and stir to distribute. Add the tofu, and toss to mix (if you stir it, the tofu will lose its shape).
      
    4.Give the stock mixture a good stir to incorporate anything that may have settled, and then pour it over the pork and tofu. Toss to coat, then boil until the sauce thickens.
    
    5.Garnished with the green parts of the green onions, then serve with hot rice.
